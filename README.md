# Olympic Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze Olympic data, including information about athletes, events, and National Olympic Committees (NOCs). The dataset covers a wide range of historical Olympic Games, allowing for the exploration of trends, performance analysis, and the relationship between different nations and sports.

### Files in the Project

1. **`noc_regions.csv`**  
   Contains information about National Olympic Committees (NOCs), including their region and notes where applicable.
   - **Columns:**
     - `NOC`: Three-letter abbreviation of the National Olympic Committee.
     - `region`: Name of the region or country.
     - `notes`: Additional information, such as historical changes in NOC names or structure.

2. **`athlete_events.csv`**  
   A comprehensive dataset with detailed information about athletes who participated in Olympic events across different years and seasons.
   - **Columns:**
     - `ID`: Unique identifier for each athlete.
     - `Name`: Athlete's name.
     - `Sex`: Gender of the athlete.
     - `Age`: Age of the athlete at the time of the event.
     - `Height`: Athlete's height (in cm).
     - `Weight`: Athlete's weight (in kg).
     - `Team`: The team or country the athlete represented.
     - `NOC`: National Olympic Committee code.
     - `Games`: Specific edition of the Olympic Games (year and season).
     - `Year`: Year of the Olympic Games.
     - `Season`: Either "Summer" or "Winter" Olympics.
     - `City`: Host city of the Olympic Games.
     - `Sport`: The sport in which the athlete participated.
     - `Event`: Specific event the athlete competed in.
     - `Medal`: The medal won by the athlete, if any (Gold, Silver, Bronze).

3. **`Olympic Games.dbc`**  
   The databricks file, containing the code to analyse the datasets.
## Project Objectives

- Perform detailed analysis on athlete participation, performance trends, and medal distributions across different countries and sports.
- Analyze the correlation between athlete demographics (e.g., height, weight, age) and their performance in different sports.
- Investigate the evolution of sports, events, and participating nations over time.
- Explore the impact of geopolitical changes reflected in the NOC data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Databricks account

### Sample Analysis

A basic exploration of the `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv` files can provide insights into:
- The top-performing countries in different Olympic Games.
- The relationship between an athleteâ€™s physical attributes and their chances of winning a medal.
- Historical NOC changes and their impact on Olympic participation.

## Future Work

- Further process the `Olympic Games.dbc` file for potential new insights.
- Perform advanced statistical modeling to predict medal outcomes based on athlete and event characteristics.
- Explore visualizations of global Olympic trends using interactive dashboards using Tableau, PowerBI etc.
